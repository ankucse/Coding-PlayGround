# 🚀 User Management API - A Spring Boot CRUD Playground 🚀

Welcome to the User Management API! This project is a comprehensive, yet easy-to-understand, RESTful web service built with Spring Boot. It serves as a perfect "playground" for demonstrating core concepts of building a modern Java backend application, including REST APIs, dependency injection, data persistence, and robust exception handling.

This application provides a complete set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing user resources.
